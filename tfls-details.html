							I spent the longest stretch of my career at Tianjin Foreign Language School which offered a supportive environment and many opportunities for growth. As Head of Humanities and English, I was able to make many significant contributions to the curriculum, including creating the AP Capstone program, data-driven analysis of student behavior and results, and leading the TOEFL integration program. 
							While at TFLS, I completed my MA.ed which allowed me to take a very data-driven approach to teaching. It was also there that I really developed my expertise in AP attending numerous trainings and taking on responsibilities for many aspects of the AP program. I also brought those insight company-wide as a member of the Dipont Education English Curriculum Committee. I presented my research findings and teaching practice at the annual Dipont Conference in Wuxi on four separate occasions reaching nearly 500 of my fellow educators.
