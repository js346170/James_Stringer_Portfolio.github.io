							Delta Global School was my next stop. i was attracted to the school because of its nature as a scholarship driven international school. I wanted to give back in a way that I wasn't really able to at other schools. I also knew as a new school there would be ample opportunity for prefessional growth and a real chance to leave a mark on the school.
							I was given near free reign to develop a social studies curiculum, which I did so following the principles of understanding by design.I also brought my expertise in AP Capstone to the school, where I taught the AP Seminar course, assissted other seminar teachers, and helped develop the AP Research course. I brought Noodletools and National History Day project 
							implementation to the school, which were both new to the school. Currently we are working on developing the National History day into a departmetn wide project as well as assissting other departments in developing similar long term activities. I was also the advisor for the DGS Pioneer, the school newspaper, where I helped students develop their writing and reporting skills. It was at DGS' request that 
							I study economics so I have enrolled in <a href="Econ-detail.html">Oregon State University</a>. I am on the honor roll and have completed 16 credits. I am preparing to teach AP Microeconomics in the fall of 2025. Due to my interest in technology I was also a member of the AI professional learning community which implemented the schools AI policy. I wil be the head of the PLC in fall 2025.
