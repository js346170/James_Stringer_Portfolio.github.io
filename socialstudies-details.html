							I was attracted to my current position because DGS is a scholarship-driven international school and I wanted to give back in a way that I wasn't really able to at other schools.  I also knew that at a new school there would be ample opportunity for professional growth, and a real chance to leave a mark on the institution.
							I was given free reign to develop a social studies curiculum, following the principles of Understanding by Design. I also brought my expertise in AP Capstone to DGS, teaching the AP Seminar course, assissting other seminar teachers, and developing the AP Research course. I brought in new tools and programs such as Noodletools and National History Day projects. 
							 Currently we are working on developing the National History day into a department-wide project, as well as assisting other departments in developing similar long term enrichment plans. I also served as the advisor for the DGS Pioneer, the student newspaper, where I helped students develop their writing and reporting skills. It was at DGS' request that 
							I study economics so I have enrolled in a Bachelor of Science program at <a href="Econ-detail.html">Oregon State University</a>, where I am on the honor roll and have completed 16 credits. I am preparing to teach AP Microeconomics in Fall of 2025. Due to my interest in technology, I joined the AI professional learning community which implemented the school's first AI policy. I will be the head of the PLC in fall 2025.

							My interest and expertise in information technology and data science has also been a great asset to DGS.
