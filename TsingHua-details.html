						<p>
							At Tsinghua International School I taught Humanities and AP US history. I was the lead on the Ethnography project for two years. This program involved a collaboration with a nonprofit operating in China's Yunnan province on the boarder with Myanmar, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PropRoots/">Prop Roots</a>.
							The first year the project had to be altered at the last minute due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We were unable to travel to Yunnan, so we had to adapt the project to an something we could do in Beijing. We searched for numerous potential locations that could 
							handle 60+ students. In the end we made it into a project about the culture of the shopping mall, looking at how China had changed in the students lifetime. Despite the changes it was a major success. The second year we were able to travel to Yunnan and work with Prop Roots directly.
							We spent a week in the field, interviewing and working with the local community. The students were able to learn about the local culture and history, while also contributing to the nonprofit's efforts in the region. It was a lifetime experience for the students and a major test of my project management skills. </br>
							Another major accomplishment was my work on the schools Homeroom Committee as co-chair. I worked with the other co-chair to develop a new system for managing homeroom activities and communication between teachers and students. This included creating a new schedule for homeroom activities, developing a system for tracking student progress, and implementing a new communication platform for teachers and students.
							This involved training teachers on the new system and ensuring that it was implemented effectively. The new system has been a major success, leading to improved communication and collaboration between teachers and students.</br>
							Additionally, I was a major part of THIS' particiaption in the annnual <a href="https://nhd.org/en/">National History Day</a>. I implemented the learning system <a href="https://www.noodletools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NoodleTools</a> for studnets to use in their research and project development. This system allowed students to organize their research, create outlines, and develop their projects in a more structured way. It also provided a platform for students to collaborate and share their work with each other.</br>
							The department was very data driven, and I was able to use my skills in data analysis to help the department make informed decisions about curriculum and instruction. I used data from student assessments and surveys to identify areas for improvement and develop strategies to address them. This included analyzing student performance data to identify trends and patterns, as well as conducting surveys to gather feedback from students and teachers.

							This experience at Tsinghua International School has been invaluable in my professional development. I have learned how to manage complex projects, collaborate with diverse teams, and use data to inform decision-making.
