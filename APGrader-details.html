						<p>
							In order to expand my undertanding of the AP exam process and to gain experience in standardized testing, I applied to be an AP Grader for the College Board's AP US history exam. This role involved grading AP exams in a fair and consistent manner, ensuring that students received accurate scores based on their performance.
							<ul>
								<li>Graded AP exams in a timely and efficient manner</li>
								<li>Maintained high standards of accuracy and consistency</li>
								<li>Collaborated with other graders to ensure fair evaluation</li>
								<li>Participated in training sessions to understand grading rubrics and standards</li>
								<li>Provided constructive feedback to students based on exam responses</li>
								<li>Attended professional development seminars and feedback sessions</li>
								<li>Gained insights into how the exam results are quantitatively analyzed</li>
								<li>Participated in quality-control exercises</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							I gained valuable insights into the exam process and the standards expected of students. I also learned more about the role of data in education and assessment. This experience has enhanced my understanding of assessment practices and has allowed me to contribute to the educational community in a meaningful way.
