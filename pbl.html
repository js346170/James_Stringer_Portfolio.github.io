						<h1>Problem-Based Learning (PBL) Course Development</h1>
					</header>

					<p>In response to the growing demand for Problem-Based Learning (PBL) at Tianjin Foreign Language School, I was tasked with developing a new course centered around PBL principles. After the success of the AP Capstone program, the school wanted to extend the reach of PBL to enhance student engagement and foster independent learning.</p>

					<h2>Course Overview</h2>
					<p>The PBL course was designed to empower students to take ownership of their learning through self-directed projects. Key elements of the course included:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Students designing a project based on their personal interests.</li>
						<li>Weekly progress updates and step-by-step research and development assessments.</li>
						<li>Regular round-table discussions to encourage peer feedback and collaborative problem-solving.</li>
						<li>A final product showcasing the culmination of their research and creativity.</li>
						<li>A professional-style poster presentation conference for parents, modeled on academic poster conferences.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Project Examples</h2>
					<p>Projects developed by students included:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A trebuchet designed and built from scratch.</li>
						<li>A WeChat mini program developed to address a local problem.</li>
						<li>An analysis of water samples to determine water safety in the local environment.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Collaboration with Counseling Department</h2>
					<p>This course was developed in collaboration with the counseling department, to foster integration of the PBL experience with students' college application essays and interviews. Our goal was to not only provide students with valuable learning experiences but also to prepare them for future academic pursuits.</p>

					<h2>Implementation at Other Schools</h2>
					<p>Following the success at Tianjin Foreign Language School, I have continued to implement and refine PBL in courses at Tsinghua International School and Delta Global School, where it has become a core component of the curriculum.</p>
