						<p>
							My teaching career began at Shane English School, where I taught English to children aged 3-12. This role was my first experience in a classroom setting and provided me with a solid foundation in teaching methodologies and classroom management as well as using computers in the classroom.
							<ul>
								<li>Developed and implemented lesson plans for various age groups</li>
								<li>Utilized interactive teaching methods to engage young learners</li>
								<li>Created audio visual teaching aids</li>
								<li>Assessed student progress and provided feedback to parents</li>
								<li>Participated in professional development workshops</li>
								<li>Collaborated with colleagues to enhance the curriculum</li>
								<li>Teaching English in a holistic setting, for example, English language cooking classes</li>
								<li>Conducted parent-teacher conferences to discuss student progress</li>
								<li>Planning and executing special events and craft based activities for students such as Halloween parties, Childrenâ€™s Day events, and Fourth of July picnics</li>
								<li>Awarded by Shane English School for consistently excellent student retention and teaching quality for the year 2010</li>
							<ul>
								
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							After two years at Shane, I had gained valuable experience in teaching and classroom management. I was able to develop my own teaching style and learn how to effectively engage young learners. This experience laid the groundwork for my future roles in education, specifically my first high school social studies position at Ambright Education.
