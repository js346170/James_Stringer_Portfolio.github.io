						<p>
							After being hired by Delta Global School, I was asked whether I could teach Economics. I had no experience with Econ except for taking AP Macro back in high school. 
							My response was to say, I can't teach it yet but I will be able to by the time you need me. This led me to Oregon State University where I took my first
							economics class. While studying, I discovered a serious interest in the subject as well as rediscovering my old interest in statistics and data science. 
							I ended up taking a full course load of economics and computer science classes, and working towards a BS in Economics and Computer Science.
							<ul>
								<li>Honor roll with 4.0 GPA</li>
								<li>Economic theory and practice</li>
								<li>Calculus for management and social sciences</li>
								<li>Utility maximization, Cost minimization, Profit maximization functions</li>
								<li>Behavioral economics</li>
								<li>Econometrics</li>
								<li>Python for finance</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							With this new knowledge I intend to upgrade my teaching practice as well as expanding my role into educational technology and data. I have already taken on the role of tech and data specialist at my current position.
