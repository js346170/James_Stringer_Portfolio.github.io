							This MA project was the result of me seeing low achieving students with limited English proficiency and my concern that they would not be able to succeed in the universities thay had been accepted to.
							I was primarily concerned that they were putting an excessive weight on standardized tests like the TOEFL which did not seem to lead to better English proficiency. At this time, training schools like New Oriental
							were actually teaching students how to take the test rather than how to use English in real life. My suspicion was that testwise strategies were effective at taking the test but were harming their ability to learn in English.
							I conducted a mixed methods study collecting quatitative and qualitative data from students. 
							<ul>
								<li>Conducted a focus group with randomly selected studnets</li>
								<li>Used this data to develop openended interviews</li>
								<li>Conducted survey of all students </li>
								<li>Conducted statistical analysis of data</li>
								<li>Created viuals and charts in excel</li>
								<li>Complete details can be found in <a href="projects.html">projects</a> and instruments can be found in <a href="samples.html">samples</a></li>
							</ul>

						<p>
							The findings were very significant. I found a strong use of testwise strategies and a clearer understanding of students logic in using them. I also found a notable correlation between TOEFL scores and high school GPA.
						Top students and low achieving students were correlated with their TOEFL scores. However, students in the middle had no correlation between GPA and TOEFL score. This suggests a major effect of testwise strategies on middle achieving students.
					These findings were presented to the school administration leading to the TOEFL integration <a href="projects.html">projects</a>. These results lead to my inclusion in the company wide English Curiculum Committee and the results were presented at the 2018 Dipont Conference. 					</div>
